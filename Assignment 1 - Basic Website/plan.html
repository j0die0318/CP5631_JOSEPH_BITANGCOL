    <h1>CP1406/CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Joseph Adrian Bitangcol</p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
        The main goal of the website is to increase patient engagement and appointment bookings at 100SMILES Dental Care
        by at least 30% over the next six months. This will be achieved by transforming the clinic’s online presence
        into a modern, user-friendly, and informative platform that reflects the warmth and professionalism of the
        practice. The site will serve as a central hub for patients to learn about services, meet the team, access
        educational resources, and take advantage of promotional offers. By improving accessibility, trust, and clarity,
        the website will help convert casual visitors into loyal patients.
